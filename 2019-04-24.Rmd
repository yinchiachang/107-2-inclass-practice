## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
Vec1 <- c(1:6)
Vec1
```
```{r}
Mat1 <- matrix(c(1:6),2,3)
class(Mat1)
typeof(Mat1)
```

```{r}
Mat1
Mat1[[2]]
```

```{r}
Mat2 <- matrix(c("a","b","c","d"),2,2)
Mat2
```
```{r}
Mat2[1]
Mat2[[1]]
```
